# 1 A Quick Deployment of Markov Decision Process in PartiallyUnknown 3D Discrete Space
## 1.1 Problem Definition
Markov Decision Process works well in 2D, but 3D space? Unsafe environment w/ limited info?
Problem setup: discrete space, hidden obstacles, scanning function
Transition matrix is introduced more here
