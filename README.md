# 1 A Quick Deployment of Markov Decision Process in Partially-Unknown 3D Discrete Space
## 1.1 Problem Definition
Markov Decision Process works well in 2D, but 3D space? Unsafe environment w/ limited info?
Problem setup: discrete space, hidden obstacles, scanning function
Transition matrix is introduced more here

## 1.2 Methods
### 1.2.1 Value iteration
Need to determine the transition matrix

7 actions: all directions + scan

What about hidden blocks? 
Na√Øve Simplification of the problem: a priori num of hidden obstacles (In real-world: uncharted water area)
Now we just need to know how many hidden obstacles are found and move to corresponding states.
